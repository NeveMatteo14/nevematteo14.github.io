          <h2 class="fs-4">What is it?</h2>
          <p>
            MoonRust is an interpreter for a subset of the Lua programming
            language, written using Rust. An <i>interpreter</i> is a program
            that directly executes another program without translating it into a
            machine language. A web demo is coming soon, but for now you can
            check it out on my
            <a

              >Github page</a
            >!
          </p>
          <h2 class="fs-4">Why?</h2>
          <p>
            This was a collaboration between me and classmates
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taekhwanoh/">James Oh</a> and
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/renee-veit/">Renee Veit</a> (I
            encourage you to check them out too!) as part of a course on the
            Rust programming language. I had a growing interest in building a
            compiler, and my teammates were up to the challenge. However,
            compilers being massive undertakings even in the simplest of cases,
            and the fact that we only had half a semester to complete this, we
            scaled it down to something more manageable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interpreters are nice because there are only two major steps:
            parsing the code into a useful data structure and traversing the
            data structure to evaluate the program's result. Lua is also a very
            simple language with a relatively small amount of features, making
            it a good choice for our project. For time sake however, we decided
            to leave some more advanced features out, like error handling,
            coroutines, and chunks.

            This demo shows off the evaluation of a few different Lua programs,
            which are run from the console. Each time MoonRust executes, it
            outputs the internal parse tree and evaluates the Lua program from
            that tree. We included some special built-in functions to get input
            from the user and print text to the console so that the final
            results are visible.
          </p>
          <h2 class="fs-4">Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            The first main challenge was parsing. Our problems stem from two
            factors. First, we used
            <a href="https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom">Nom</a>, a parser
            combinator library, for our parsing needs. Nom is a great library,
            but it suffers from the same problems all recursive descent parsers
            have: it can't handle ambiguity. The
            <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#9"
              >Lua syntax specification</a
            >
            is full of ambiguous rules, and if you follow them directly using
            Nom, as we did, the parser will run into an infinite loop. Thus, we
            had to restructure the grammar to eliminate things like left
            recursion and clarify which binary operators had precedence over
            others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another challenge was implementing the runtime environment for
            variables in Lua. Rust has strict ownership rules where values can
            only be tied to one owning variable. This is not the case with Lua,
            where multiple variables can reference the same value. In order to
            accomodate this, we made use of Rust's <code>Rc</code> and
            <code>RefCell</code>. The <code>Rc</code> struct counts the number
            of references to a given value, allowing them to have more than one
            owner at a time. <code>RefCell</code> allows for borrowing rules to
            be dynamically checked at runtime, meaning we can mutably borrow a
            value while other immutable references exist. By combining both
            structs, we can simulate Lua's rules for values and variables:
            multiple variables can point to the same value, and changes made to
            the value are reflected in every variable that references them.
            Pretty neat!

            This is my personal website where you can find out more about my
            work experience and my other personal projects. Right now, it's
            written entirely with HTML and CSS with Bootstrap.

          <h2 class="fs-4">
            Why not <i>[insert JavaScript framework here]</i>?
          </h2>
          <p>
            In its current state, my website makes no use of any dynamic
            content. Could I have made this a fancy single-page application with
            event hooks and state management? Absolutely! I might even rebuild
            this site in React or Angular at some point in the future when I
            want those things. Right now though, I find that to be overkill for
            what should be something very simple and lightweight.
          </p>
          <h2 class="fs-4">
            Why not a content management system or static site generator?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Sticking with my previous point, I wanted to keep things simple. I
            currently don't need to keep track of analytics or add
            user-generated content to my website. Plus, I wanted full control
            over how my website was styled and laid out. Many of the themes for
            Hugo or Jekyll didn't really appeal to me and what I wanted. It's
            also more fun to do it yourself anyways!
